# Forest Fire & Smoke Detection using YOLOv8 & YOLOv7
### a demo project in the context of the course "Machine Learning and Content Analytics" of the MSc in Business Analytics at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB)
#### ~ <a href="https://forestfiresmokedetection.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">Streamlit App</a>
This project serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of two pre-trained models for inference tasksâ€”YOLOv8 and YOLOv7. Both models have been trained using identical parameters, including the dataset, computational resources, number of epochs, and other characteristics. The models are integrated within a serverless <b>Streamlit</b> application for seamless user interaction.<br>
The dataset used for training is the [Fire Image Dataset V2](https://universe.roboflow.com/kirzone/fire-iejes/dataset/2#) from [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/) (on open source website) and the models were trained on a Google Colab instance with a T4 GPU.<br><br>
## Repository Structure:
- <b>models</b>: Contains the weights of the trained models as well as the configuration files used for training (scroll down for the exact location of the weights)
- <b>preview_predictions</b>: Contains the original and the predicted images and videos for demonstration purposes
- <b>times</b>: Contains the test made on the two models on a dataset of 2750 images, to test their inference time (to run the script [model_times.ipynb](times/model_times.ipynb), clone the repo and place it outside the "times" folder)
- <span style="color:red"><b>Report.pdf</b></span>: Contains the detailed report of this project
- <span style="color:orange"><b>streamlit_app.py</b></span>: Contains the code for the Streamlit App
- <span style="color:orange"><b>predict_from_model.ipynb</b></span>: Contains the code for inference on an image for both models

## Google Colab Notebooks used for training:
- [YOLOv8](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oOhKRR0QGHGdBYt3ru9HHZj8VXdTlAv3)
- [YOLOv7](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lWRhfprK58WxoUX5I38y3GW6-1rCWfzp#scrollTo=GD9gUQpaBxNa)

## Model Weights:
- [YOLOv8 Model Weights](models/yolov8/weights/fire_model.pt)
- [YOLOv7 Model Weights](models/yolov7/runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt)

## Instructions & Inference besides Streamlit App:
- Clone the repo
- Install the requirements.txt file by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- Open "predict_from_model.ipynb" file and run the cells given the path to the image you want to predict
- The predictions will be saved in the "runs" folder
